## What this means

Information, status, or instructions must not rely on color alone to be understood. Any meaning conveyed through color must also be available through text, icons, patterns, or programmatic cues.

Users should be able to perceive the same information regardless of their ability to distinguish colors.

## Why this matters

Users with color vision deficiencies may not perceive differences in color. If color is the only indicator, critical information can be missed.

Screen reader users and users of high contrast or forced color modes may not perceive color styling at all. Redundant cues ensure information is consistently available.

## What to check for

- Color-coded information is also conveyed through text or symbols.
- Required fields, errors, and statuses have non-color indicators.
- Charts and graphs include labels or patterns in addition to color.
- Links are distinguishable without relying on color alone.
- Assistive technologies can access the same meaning programmatically.

## What to avoid

- Using color as the only way to indicate errors, success, or selection.
- Relying on color differences without additional cues.
- Removing text or icons once color is applied.
- Assuming all users can perceive or interpret color correctly.
