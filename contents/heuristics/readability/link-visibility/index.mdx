## What this means

When links are not underlined, they must include another clear visual cue that identifies them as links. Users should be able to recognize links without interacting with them.

Visual cues may include styling such as color contrast, icons, font treatment, or other consistent indicators. These cues must be perceivable without relying on color alone.

## Why this matters

Users rely on visual affordances to identify interactive elements. If links are not clearly distinguishable from surrounding text, users may miss navigation options or misunderstand content.

Clear link identification also supports users with cognitive disabilities and low vision. Predictable visual patterns improve scanning and reduce uncertainty.

## What to check for

- Links without underlines have a consistent visual indicator.
- The indicator is perceivable without relying on color alone.
- Link styling is distinct from surrounding body text.
- Hover and focus states reinforce link affordance.
- Visual cues are consistent across the interface.

## What to avoid

- Removing underlines without providing another cue.
- Relying on color differences alone to indicate links.
- Using link styling that closely matches body text.
- Introducing inconsistent link treatments across pages.
