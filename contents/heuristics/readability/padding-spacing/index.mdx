## What this means

Users must be able to adjust text spacing without content being hidden, overlapped, or made unusable. This includes line height, paragraph spacing, letter spacing, word spacing, and padding around text.

Content and functionality must remain intact when users apply custom styles through browser settings, extensions, or user stylesheets.

## Why this matters

Users with low vision, dyslexia, or cognitive disabilities often adjust spacing to improve readability. If layouts break when spacing changes, content can become difficult or impossible to use.

Screen reader and keyboard users may also be affected when spacing changes disrupt focus order, visibility, or interactive controls.

## What to check for

- Content remains readable when line height is increased.
- Text does not overlap or clip when spacing is adjusted.
- Interactive elements remain usable with increased padding.
- Containers expand to accommodate increased spacing.
- No content or functionality is lost when custom spacing is applied.

## What to avoid

- Fixed heights that clip text when spacing changes.
- Absolute positioning that causes overlap.
- Preventing users from applying custom styles.
- Hiding overflow that conceals expanded content.
