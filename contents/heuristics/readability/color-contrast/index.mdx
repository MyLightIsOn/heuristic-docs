## What this means

Text must have enough contrast against its background to be readable. Contrast is determined by the luminance difference between the text color and the background color.

Minimum contrast ratios apply to most text. Larger text and non-essential decorative text may have different requirements.

## Why this matters

Users with low vision or color vision deficiencies may not be able to read low-contrast text. Poor contrast also affects users in bright environments or on low-quality displays.

Sufficient contrast improves readability for all users. It reduces eye strain and supports comprehension across a wide range of viewing conditions.

## What to check for

- Text meets minimum contrast ratios against its background.
- Contrast is maintained across all states, including hover and focus.
- Text remains readable in high contrast and forced color modes.
- Background images do not reduce text readability.
- Icons that convey meaning meet contrast requirements.

## What to avoid

- Using low-contrast color combinations.
- Relying on color alone to convey information.
- Placing text over images without ensuring sufficient contrast.
- Reducing contrast for disabled or secondary text.
