## What this means

Informative images, charts, and graphs must have an accessible name that clearly describes their purpose or content. The accessible name must convey the same meaningful information that is available visually.

For complex visuals, the accessible name may provide a concise summary, with additional text elsewhere to convey full details when needed.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users cannot perceive visual content without text alternatives. Without a meaningful accessible name, important information may be missing or unclear.

Users with low vision or who disable images also rely on accessible names to understand visual content. Clear descriptions ensure information is available regardless of how content is perceived.

## What to check for

- Informative images have an appropriate accessible name.
- Charts and graphs include a summary that explains their purpose or key insight.
- Accessible names are accurate, concise, and meaningful.
- Decorative images are not given informative names.
- Assistive technologies announce the accessible name correctly.

## What to avoid

- Leaving informative images without an accessible name.
- Using file names or generic text as descriptions.
- Overloading accessible names with excessive detail.
- Relying on surrounding visual context alone to explain images.
