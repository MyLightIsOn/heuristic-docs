## What this means

Every form control must have a label that clearly describes its purpose. The label should communicate what information is required or what action the control performs.

Meaningful labels are provided through visible text or programmatic associations. This includes label elements, aria-label, or aria-labelledby when used correctly.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on labels to understand form fields. If labels are missing, vague, or incorrect, users may not know what data to enter.

Clear labels also support keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. They reduce errors and make forms easier to complete and review.

## What to check for

- Each form control has a programmatically associated label.
- Labels clearly describe the expected input or action.
- Required fields are indicated in a way that is accessible.
- Placeholder text is not used as a replacement for labels.
- Assistive technologies announce an accurate and specific label.

## What to avoid

- Missing labels or labels that are visually hidden without an accessible name.
- Generic labels such as “input” or “field.”
- Using only placeholder text to describe a field.
- Labels that do not match the actual purpose of the control.
