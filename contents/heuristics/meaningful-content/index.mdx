# Meaningful Content

This category covers heuristics that ensure content is clear, descriptive, and understandable to all users, regardless of how they access it.

## Why this matters

Content must be self-explanatory and provide sufficient context for users to:
- Understand what interactive elements do
- Navigate efficiently through pages and forms
- Make informed decisions
- Access information regardless of sensory ability

Meaningful content reduces confusion, prevents errors, and ensures everyone can use your interface effectively.
