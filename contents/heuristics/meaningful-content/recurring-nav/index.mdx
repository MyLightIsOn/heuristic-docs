## What this means

Recurring navigation patterns and shared functionalities should be presented in a consistent way wherever they appear. Users encounter the same structure, placement, and labeling for navigation and common actions across the system.

Consistency applies to how components look, how they behave, and how they are named. A control that performs the same function should not change its appearance, interaction, or label based on location.

Accessible names and programmatic labels follow the same consistency. Assistive technologies announce the same control using the same name and role across contexts.

## Why this matters

Users build mental models as they move through an interface. When navigation patterns or labels change unexpectedly, those models break and users must slow down to reorient themselves.

Inconsistent labeling can cause screen reader users to interpret identical actions as different controls. This increases cognitive load and can lead to errors or hesitation during task completion.

Consistent patterns support predictability and efficiency. They reduce the effort required to learn and use the interface, particularly for users with cognitive disabilities or those relying on assistive technologies.

## What to check for

- Navigation structures remain stable across pages that serve similar purposes.
- Identical actions use the same visible text and accessible name wherever they appear.
- Repeated components behave the same way for mouse, keyboard, and touch interactions.
- Icons representing the same function are paired with consistent text or accessible labels.
- Roles, states, and properties exposed to assistive technologies do not vary between instances.

## What to avoid

- Changing labels for the same action without a clear and necessary distinction.
- Moving or restructuring navigation in similar views without user benefit.
- Using different visual treatments to represent the same functionality.
- Implementing repeated components with different accessibility semantics.
