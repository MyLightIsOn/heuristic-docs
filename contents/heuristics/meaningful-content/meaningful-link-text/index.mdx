## What this means

Every link must have text that clearly describes its destination or purpose. The link text should make sense on its own without relying on surrounding content.

Meaningful link text is provided through visible text or an accessible name. This includes text content, aria-label, or aria-labelledby when appropriate.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users often navigate by links. When link text is vague or repetitive, it becomes difficult to understand where a link goes.

Meaningful link text also supports keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. Clear labels reduce confusion and improve efficiency when scanning or navigating a page.

## What to check for

- Link text describes the destination, action, or result.
- Links with the same destination use consistent text.
- Icon-only links have an accessible name that conveys purpose.
- Links remain understandable when read out of context.
- Assistive technologies announce a clear and specific link name.

## What to avoid

- Generic text such as “click here” or “read more.”
- Repeating identical link text for different destinations.
- Relying on surrounding text alone to explain a link’s purpose.
- Using URLs as link text when they are not meaningful to users.
