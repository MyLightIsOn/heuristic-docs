## What this means

When an error occurs, it must be communicated using text. Users should be able to understand what went wrong without relying on color, icons, sound, or visual position alone.

Error text must be programmatically available so assistive technologies can announce it. The message should clearly identify the error and relate it to the affected input or action.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users cannot perceive visual cues such as red outlines or icons. Without text, errors may go unnoticed or be impossible to understand.

Text-based error descriptions also support users with low vision, color vision deficiencies, or cognitive disabilities. Clear messages reduce frustration and help users recover efficiently.

## What to check for

- Errors are described using clear, readable text.
- Error messages identify the specific problem.
- The error text is associated with the relevant field or action.
- Assistive technologies announce error messages when they appear.
- Errors are not conveyed by color or icons alone.

## What to avoid

- Indicating errors only with color, symbols, or sound.
- Displaying generic messages that do not explain the issue.
- Showing error states without any accompanying text.
- Placing error text where it is not programmatically related to the error.
