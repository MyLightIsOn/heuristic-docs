## What this means

When multiple links or interactive elements are placed next to each other and all lead to the same destination or closely related destinations, they should be combined into a single, clear call to action.

Adjacent links that appear separate but perform the same action can create confusion about what is clickable and where an action will lead. It also creates unnecessary steps for keyboard users. A single, well defined CTA reduces ambiguity and simplifies interaction.

This applies to text links, buttons, icons, cards, headlines with links, and any other interactive elements that are visually grouped.

## Why this matters

Screen reader and keyboard users encounter each interactive element individually. When several adjacent links point to the same or similar destination, users may have to navigate through redundant options that do not provide additional value.

Redundant links increase cognitive load and slow down navigation. This makes it harder to understand the structure and purpose of the content. This can be especially frustrating for users who rely on keyboard navigation or screen reader link lists.

Combining adjacent links into a single CTA improves clarity and reduces unnecessary focus stops. This creates a more predictable and efficient experience for all users.

## What to check for

- Are there multiple adjacent links or clickable elements that navigate to the same page or perform the same action?
- Do linked headlines, images, and supporting text all point to the same destination without being grouped into a single interactive element?
- Can the number of focusable elements be reduced without removing meaningful choices?

## What to avoid

- Placing several links next to each other that all lead to the same destination.
- Making entire content blocks partially clickable while also including separate links inside them that perform the same action.
- Repeating the same CTA multiple times in close proximity without adding clarity or choice.
- Creating extra focus stops that do not provide additional information or control.
