## What this means

Form labels must be visible and remain present at all times. Users should be able to identify the purpose of each field before, during, and after interaction.

Labels should not disappear when a field receives focus or when input is entered. The label must remain available to support understanding and review.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on labels to understand form fields consistently. If labels are hidden or removed, users may lose context when navigating or revisiting fields.

Visible and persistent labels also support users with cognitive disabilities, low vision, or memory impairments. They reduce errors and make forms easier to complete, correct, and verify.

## What to check for

- Each form control has a visible label at all times.
- Labels remain visible when the field is focused or filled.
- Floating labels do not obscure or replace the label text.
- Labels are not conveyed by placeholder text alone.
- The visible label matches the programmatic accessible name.

## What to avoid

- Labels that disappear on focus or after input.
- Using placeholder text as the only visible label.
- Revealing labels only on hover or focus.
- Relying on visual position or styling alone to convey meaning.
