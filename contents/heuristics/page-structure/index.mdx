# Page Structure

This category covers heuristics that ensure pages are well-organized with clear, semantic structure that helps all users understand and navigate content.

## Why this matters

Proper page structure:

- Helps screen reader users navigate efficiently using headings and landmarks
- Allows users to scan and understand content hierarchy
- Enables browser features like outline views and "skip to" navigation
- Improves SEO and content discoverability
- Makes content easier to maintain and style

A well-structured page is like a well-organized book with clear chapters and sections.
