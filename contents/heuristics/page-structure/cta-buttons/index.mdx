## What this means

Calls to action that trigger functionality on the current page should be implemented as buttons. The semantic role must match the behavior the user initiates.

Buttons are used for actions such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, toggling content, or updating data without navigating away.

## Why this matters

Assistive technology users rely on semantics to understand what will happen when an element is activated. When buttons are correctly used, expectations are clear and interactions are predictable.

Screen reader users often navigate by controls such as buttons. Keyboard users depend on consistent activation and focus behavior for in-page actions.

## What to check for

- CTAs that trigger in-page actions are implemented as buttons.
- Button semantics are preserved even when visually styled as links.
- Buttons expose an accessible name that describes the action.
- Assistive technologies announce the element as a button.
- Keyboard activation triggers the intended functionality.

## What to avoid

- Using links to trigger in-page functionality.
- Changing application state through elements exposed as links.
- Removing button semantics for visual styling purposes.
- Creating custom controls that do not expose the correct role.
