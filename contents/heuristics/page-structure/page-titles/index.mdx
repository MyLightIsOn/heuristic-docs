## What this means

Each page must have a title that clearly describes its content or purpose. The title is provided programmatically and is exposed to browsers and assistive technologies.

A meaningful page title reflects the primary topic or task of the page. It should be concise and specific.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on page titles to understand where they are and to move between pages efficiently. When titles are missing or vague, orientation and navigation become difficult.

Meaningful titles also support keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. Clear titles improve comprehension when switching tabs, using history, or reviewing open pages.

## What to check for

- Every page has a programmatic title.
- The title accurately describes the page’s main content or function.
- Titles are unique across the site where pages serve different purposes.
- Dynamic pages update the title when the primary content changes.
- Assistive technologies announce the correct page title.

## What to avoid

- Missing or empty page titles.
- Generic titles such as “Home” or “Page” without context.
- Reusing the same title across multiple distinct pages.
- Titles that do not reflect the current page state or content.
