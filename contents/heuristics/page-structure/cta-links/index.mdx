## What this means

Calls to action that move the user to a different page, view, or location should be implemented as links. The semantic role must match the behavior.

Links are used for navigation. Buttons are used for actions that change state, submit data, or trigger behavior on the current page.

## Why this matters

Assistive technology users rely on semantics to understand what will happen when an element is activated. When links and buttons are misused, expectations are broken.

Screen reader users often navigate by links to explore destinations. Keyboard users depend on consistent behavior when activating interactive elements.

## What to check for

- CTAs that navigate to another page are implemented as links.
- Link semantics are preserved even when styled as buttons.
- Buttons are reserved for actions that do not change location.
- Assistive technologies announce links as links.
- Keyboard activation follows expected link behavior.

## What to avoid

- Using buttons to navigate to a new page or view.
- Changing location as a side effect of a button action.
- Removing link semantics for visual styling purposes.
- Creating custom elements that do not expose the correct role.
