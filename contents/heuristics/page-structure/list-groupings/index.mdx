## What this means

Related items that form a group or sequence must be marked up as a list. Lists communicate relationships and order that are not clear from visual layout alone.

Ordered lists are used when sequence or priority matters. Unordered lists are used when items are grouped without a required order.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on list semantics to understand how items relate to one another. Lists provide context such as the number of items and the user’s position within the group.

Proper list structure also supports keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. Clear grouping improves scanning, comprehension, and navigation.

## What to check for

- Grouped or enumerated content is implemented using list elements.
- The correct list type is used based on meaning and order.
- Lists are not broken by unrelated content.
- Nested lists reflect logical sub-groupings.
- Assistive technologies announce list structure correctly.

## What to avoid

- Using line breaks or visual spacing instead of lists.
- Simulating lists with icons, numbers, or styling alone.
- Combining unrelated items into a single list.
- Using lists purely for visual layout.
