## What this means

Headings must follow a logical, hierarchical order that reflects the structure of the content. Each heading level represents a clear relationship to the content that follows it.

Heading levels must not be skipped. Content should progress sequentially from higher-level headings to lower-level headings without jumping levels.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on headings to understand page structure and to navigate efficiently. Skipped or misordered headings make content harder to follow and interpret.

A consistent heading hierarchy also supports keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. Clear structure improves orientation and comprehension when scanning or navigating content.

## What to check for

- Headings are used to describe sections of content.
- Heading levels follow a logical and sequential order.
- No heading levels are skipped.
- Visual styling does not replace proper heading markup.
- Assistive technologies announce headings and their levels correctly.

## What to avoid

- Skipping heading levels to achieve visual styling.
- Using headings purely for presentation.
- Placing content under headings of an incorrect level.
- Creating a flat structure where all headings use the same level.
