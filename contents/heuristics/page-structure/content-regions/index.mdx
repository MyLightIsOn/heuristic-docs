## What this means

Page content must be contained within appropriate landmarks or regions. Landmarks define the overall structure of the page and help users understand how content is organized.

Common landmarks include header, navigation, main, complementary, and footer. Custom regions may also be used when native landmarks are not sufficient.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on landmarks to navigate pages efficiently. When content exists outside of landmarks, it may be harder to find or understand in context.

Landmarks also support keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. A clear structure improves orientation and reduces the effort required to move through content.

## What to check for

- All visible content is contained within a landmark or region.
- Each landmark has a clear and appropriate role.
- The main content is contained within a single main landmark.
- Repeated content uses consistent landmarks across pages.
- Assistive technologies can identify and navigate landmarks.

## What to avoid

- Placing content outside of any landmark or region.
- Using multiple main landmarks on the same page.
- Applying landmark roles purely for visual grouping.
- Creating regions without an accessible name when required.
