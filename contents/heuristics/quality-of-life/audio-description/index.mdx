## What this means

Pre-recorded videos must include audio descriptions for important visual information that is not conveyed through dialogue. Audio description provides spoken narration of visual content that is necessary to understand the video.

The description must be available in a way that can be perceived by assistive technologies and users who cannot see the visual content.

## Why this matters

Blind and low vision users cannot perceive visual-only information such as actions, settings, or on-screen text. Without audio description, key context or meaning may be lost.

Audio description also supports users who are multitasking or cannot view the screen. It ensures that the full message of the video is accessible without relying on sight.

## What to check for

- Important visual information is described in audio.
- Descriptions are synchronized with the video.
- Audio descriptions do not overlap critical dialogue.
- On-screen text is included in the audio description when needed.
- Users can access the audio-described version of the video.

## What to avoid

- Relying on visuals alone to convey essential information.
- Omitting descriptions of actions, scene changes, or visual cues.
- Providing descriptions that are incomplete or unclear.
- Assuming dialogue alone conveys all necessary context.
