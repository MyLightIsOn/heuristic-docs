## What this means

When an error occurs, users are given clear suggestions on how to fix it. The guidance explains what needs to change, not just that something is wrong.

Suggestions are provided in text and are available to assistive technologies. They are presented at the time the error is identified.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users need explicit guidance to understand how to recover from errors. Error messages without suggestions can leave users unsure how to proceed.

Clear correction guidance also supports users with cognitive disabilities and users unfamiliar with the task. It reduces trial and error and improves task completion rates.

## What to check for

- Error messages include specific suggestions for correction.
- Suggestions describe how to resolve the error.
- Guidance is provided in text and announced by assistive technologies.
- Suggestions are relevant to the specific error condition.
- Users can correct errors without guessing.

## What to avoid

- Identifying errors without explaining how to fix them.
- Using vague guidance such as “invalid input.”
- Providing suggestions that are not actionable.
- Requiring users to infer corrections from visual cues alone.
