## What this means

Pre-recorded videos that contain audio must include captions. Captions provide a text version of spoken dialogue and other meaningful audio information.

Captions must be synchronized with the video and available whenever the video is played.

## Why this matters

Deaf and hard of hearing users rely on captions to access audio content. Without captions, spoken information and context may be completely unavailable.

Captions also support users in noisy or quiet environments, users with cognitive disabilities, and users who cannot play audio. They improve comprehension and flexibility for all users.

## What to check for

- All pre-recorded videos with audio include captions.
- Captions accurately reflect spoken dialogue and relevant sounds.
- Captions are synchronized with the video playback.
- Captions are readable and not obscured by other content.
- Users can enable captions when the video is played.

## What to avoid

- Publishing videos with audio and no captions.
- Using auto-generated captions without review.
- Omitting non-speech audio that conveys meaning.
- Providing captions that are out of sync or incomplete.
