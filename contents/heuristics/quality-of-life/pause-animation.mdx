## What this means

Animated content that starts automatically and continues for more than five seconds must be controllable by the user. Users must be able to pause, stop, or hide the animation.

This applies to animations, carousels, auto-updating content, and other moving elements that are not essential to the task.

## Why this matters

Continuous motion can be distracting or disorienting. Users with cognitive disabilities may have difficulty focusing when animations cannot be controlled.

Users with vestibular disorders may experience discomfort from motion. Screen reader and keyboard users also benefit when content does not change unexpectedly.

## What to check for

- Animations lasting longer than five seconds can be paused, stopped, or hidden.
- Controls are easy to find and operate.
- Controls are accessible by keyboard and assistive technologies.
- Pausing the animation does not remove access to content.
- Essential animations are limited and justified.

## What to avoid

- Auto-playing animations with no user controls.
- Hiding controls until hover or focus only.
- Restarting animations automatically after being paused.
- Using motion when a static alternative would suffice.
