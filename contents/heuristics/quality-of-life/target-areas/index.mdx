## What this means

Interactive targets must be large enough to be easily activated. This includes buttons, links, form controls, and other clickable or tappable elements.

Targets should provide sufficient size and spacing so users can activate them without precision or accidental activation of adjacent elements.

## Why this matters

Users with motor impairments may have limited fine motor control. Small or tightly spaced targets increase errors and make interaction frustrating.

Adequate target size also supports users on touch devices, users with tremors, and users in motion. Larger targets improve accuracy and ease of use for everyone.

## What to check for

- Interactive targets meet minimum size requirements.
- Sufficient spacing exists between adjacent targets.
- Targets remain usable at different zoom levels.
- Custom controls provide the same target size as native controls.
- Assistive technologies can activate targets reliably.

## What to avoid

- Very small clickable or tappable areas.
- Placing interactive elements too close together.
- Reducing target size for visual or layout reasons.
- Relying on precise pointer movement to activate controls.
