## What this means

When content or functionality has a time limit, users must be able to control it. Users should be able to turn off the time limit, adjust it, or extend it before it expires.

Time limits include session timeouts, auto-logout behavior, and timed interactions. Exceptions apply only when the time limit is essential to the activity.

## Why this matters

Users with disabilities may need more time to read, understand, or complete tasks. Fixed time limits can prevent task completion or cause loss of data.

Screen reader users, keyboard users, and users with cognitive or motor disabilities are particularly affected. Providing control over time limits supports successful and independent use.

## What to check for

- Users are warned before a time limit expires.
- Users can extend or disable the time limit.
- Instructions for managing time limits are clear and accessible.
- Assistive technologies can access and operate time controls.
- Essential time limits are clearly justified.

## What to avoid

- Ending sessions without warning.
- Providing no way to extend or control time limits.
- Resetting time limits without user action.
- Hiding time controls from keyboard or assistive technology users.
