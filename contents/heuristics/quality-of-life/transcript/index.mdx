## What this means

Pre-recorded audio-only and video-only content must have a text transcript. The transcript provides all meaningful information conveyed through audio or visuals in text form.

For audio-only content, the transcript includes spoken dialogue and relevant sounds. For video-only content, it includes descriptions of visual information needed to understand the content.

## Why this matters

Deaf and hard of hearing users rely on transcripts to access audio-only content. Blind and low vision users rely on transcripts to access video-only content.

Transcripts also support users with cognitive disabilities, users who cannot play media, and users who prefer reading. Text alternatives ensure information is accessible in different contexts and environments.

## What to check for

- Audio-only content includes a complete text transcript.
- Video-only content includes a transcript describing visual information.
- Transcripts convey the same meaning as the original media.
- Transcripts are easy to locate and access.
- Assistive technologies can read the transcript content.

## What to avoid

- Providing media without any text alternative.
- Omitting meaningful sounds or visual details from transcripts.
- Relying on captions for audio-only content.
- Placing transcripts in formats that are not accessible.
