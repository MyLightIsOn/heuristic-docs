## What this means

Images that function as interactive controls must have a meaningful accessible name. The name must describe the action or destination triggered by the image.

Active images include images used as links, buttons, or other interactive elements. Decorative images are excluded when they do not provide information or functionality.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on accessible names to understand what an interactive element does. Without a meaningful name, an active image may be announced without context or purpose.

Keyboard users and users of voice control also depend on clear names to identify and activate controls. Meaningful names make interaction predictable and efficient.

## What to check for

- Active images have an accessible name that describes their action or destination.
- The accessible name matches the visible intent of the image.
- Images used as links or buttons are announced with the correct role.
- Accessible names are provided through appropriate markup.
- Assistive technologies announce a clear and specific control name.

## What to avoid

- Leaving active images without an accessible name.
- Using file names or generic text for interactive images.
- Assigning decorative images an interactive name.
- Relying on surrounding visual context to explain the action.
