## What this means

Form errors must be identified in a way that does not depend on visual cues. Users must be able to perceive and understand errors through text and programmatic information.

Error identification should clearly indicate which field is affected and why. This information must be available to assistive technologies.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users cannot perceive visual indicators such as color, icons, or positioning. If errors rely on sight alone, they may go unnoticed or be unclear.

Keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities also benefit from clear, non-visual error identification. Explicit messages reduce confusion and support efficient error recovery.

## What to check for

- Errors are identified using text that describes the problem.
- Error messages are programmatically associated with the relevant fields.
- Errors are announced by assistive technologies when they occur.
- Color is not the only means used to indicate an error.
- Users can locate and understand errors without visual context.

## What to avoid

- Indicating errors only with color, icons, or visual placement.
- Displaying error states without descriptive text.
- Failing to associate error messages with form controls.
- Requiring users to infer errors from layout or styling changes.
