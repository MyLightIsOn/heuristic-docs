# Screen Reader Support

This category covers heuristics that ensure content works effectively with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Why this matters

Screen reader support:

- Enables blind and low-vision users to access your content
- Ensures information is conveyed programmatically, not just visually
- Provides context and status updates that sighted users get automatically
- Makes complex interactions understandable through audio
- Demonstrates commitment to inclusive design

Screen readers translate visual interfaces into audio, and proper support makes this translation accurate and efficient.
