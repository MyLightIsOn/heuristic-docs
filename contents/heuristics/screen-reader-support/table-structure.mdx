title: Do data tables have meaningful semantic column and row headers as well as a table name?

## What this means

Data tables must use semantic markup to identify column headers, row headers, and a table name. Headers define how data cells relate to each other, and the table name provides overall context.

The table name is typically provided with a caption or an accessible name. Header cells are identified programmatically so relationships are exposed to assistive technologies.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on table semantics to understand data relationships. Without headers or a table name, data may be announced without context or meaning.

Clear table structure also supports keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. It improves orientation, comprehension, and efficient navigation within tables.

## What to check for

- Data tables use semantic table markup.
- Column headers are marked as headers.
- Row headers are used where appropriate.
- The table has a meaningful name or caption.
- Assistive technologies can announce headers and table context.

## What to avoid

- Using tables for layout instead of data.
- Presenting data without semantic headers.
- Omitting a table name or caption.
- Relying on visual styling alone to indicate headers.
