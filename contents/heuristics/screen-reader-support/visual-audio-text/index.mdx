## What this means

Information that is presented visually or audibly must also be available in text. Users should be able to access the same information without relying on sight or hearing.

Visual information includes icons, charts, animations, and visual cues. Auditory information includes sounds, spoken instructions, alerts, and audio-only feedback.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users cannot access visual-only information without text alternatives. Deaf or hard of hearing users cannot perceive auditory information without text.

Providing text equivalents also supports users with cognitive disabilities and users in environments where audio or visuals are limited or unavailable. Text ensures information is consistently accessible.

## What to check for

- Visual information has an equivalent text description.
- Audio information is available through captions, transcripts, or text messages.
- Instructions are not conveyed by sound or visuals alone.
- Text alternatives convey the same meaning as the original content.
- Assistive technologies can access the text version of the information.

## What to avoid

- Presenting instructions only through sound or visuals.
- Using icons or animations without accompanying text.
- Relying on audio cues without a text equivalent.
- Providing text that does not convey the full meaning of the information.
