## What this means

Images that do not convey information or provide functionality must be identified as decorative. Decorative images should be hidden from assistive technologies so they are not announced to users.

Marking images as decorative ensures that only meaningful content is exposed through accessibility APIs. This is typically done through empty alternative text or appropriate role usage.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users depend on concise and relevant output. Announcing decorative images adds noise and makes it harder to understand important content.

Ignoring decorative images also improves efficiency for keyboard and assistive technology users. It reduces unnecessary stops and supports clearer navigation.

## What to check for

- Decorative images are marked so they are ignored by assistive technologies.
- Informative images are not incorrectly marked as decorative.
- Empty alternative text is used correctly for decorative images.
- Decorative background images do not contain meaningful information.
- Assistive technologies do not announce decorative visuals.

## What to avoid

- Providing descriptive alternative text for decorative images.
- Leaving decorative images without explicit markup.
- Using decorative images to convey important information.
- Hiding informative images from assistive technologies.
