## What this means

Each page must declare a primary language that applies to the overall content. Any changes in language within the page must also be identified programmatically.

Language is designated using appropriate markup so assistive technologies can detect and interpret it correctly.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users rely on language information to apply correct pronunciation and speech rules. When language is not identified or is incorrect, content may be mispronounced or hard to understand.

Language designation also supports translation tools and users with cognitive or learning disabilities. Clear language context improves comprehension and reduces confusion.

## What to check for

- The page has a single, correct primary language defined.
- All language changes within the content are programmatically marked.
- Language attributes accurately match the written language.
- Mixed-language content is identified at the correct scope.
- Assistive technologies announce language changes as expected.

## What to avoid

- Omitting the primary language of the page.
- Using an incorrect or overly generic language code.
- Failing to mark inline language changes.
- Applying language attributes inconsistently or unnecessarily.
