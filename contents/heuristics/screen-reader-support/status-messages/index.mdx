## What this means

Status messages that update dynamically must be announced to assistive technologies without moving visual focus. Users should receive important feedback without their current task being interrupted.

Status messages include confirmations, errors, progress updates, and other changes that are not the result of direct focus movement.

## Why this matters

Screen reader users may not be aware of dynamic changes if they are not announced programmatically. Moving focus to announce a message can also be disruptive and confusing.

Announcing status messages without shifting focus supports keyboard users and users with cognitive disabilities. It allows users to stay oriented while still receiving timely feedback.

## What to check for

- Status messages are programmatically exposed to assistive technologies.
- Messages are announced without moving visual focus.
- Appropriate roles or properties are used for live updates.
- Announcements are concise and relevant to the user’s action.
- Repeated or unnecessary announcements are avoided.

## What to avoid

- Requiring focus to move in order to announce a status message.
- Displaying visual-only updates with no programmatic announcement.
- Announcing non-essential changes that interrupt the user.
- Using incorrect roles that cause unexpected focus behavior.
