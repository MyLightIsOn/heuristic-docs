# Keyboard Interaction

This category covers heuristics that ensure users can navigate and interact with your interface using a keyboard alone, without requiring a mouse or other pointing device.

## Why this matters

Many users rely exclusively on keyboard navigation, including:
- People with motor disabilities who cannot use a mouse
- Blind users navigating with screen readers
- Power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Anyone whose pointing device has stopped working

Keyboard accessibility is fundamental to an inclusive digital experience.
